/// \section intro Program Introduction
/// The <b>Beerodex</b> application is able to keep track of all kinds of beer! The beer is stored in a database, where the information can be
/// sorted, modified, deleted, or displayed. The beer's name, brewery, type, alcohol content, and IBU (international bitunits) are tracked. This
/// program can be used by the home beer drinker, a restaurant tracking their beer menu, or anyone in between!
///
/// Features to note are:
/// 
/// -# Database loads/saves automatically on program launch/close
/// -# Database can be sorted by any of the stored fields for simplified viewing
/// -# It has a hilariously clever name
/// -# Data can be searched and modified or deleted individually
/// -# It's beer
///
/// More information about our program can be found at <A target=blank HREF="http://beerodex.com/"> our website </A>. (Note: That's not an actual website.)

The amazing Beerodex!
AUTHORS - Greg Ward and Jeremy Anderson


PURPOSE OF PROJECT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The true purpose of this project is to showcase knowledge of the Standard Template Library and general OOP principles. It's also to demonstrate knowledge and use of software design principles of a three-layer approach (a View, a Data-Access, and Domain). Design patterns are important, this is the one we found to be most effective for this project.

This design approach can be found in Bartender (the view layer, what the user will interact with), Beerfridge (the data access layer), the commands issued by the user will act through this layer to access the Beer (the domain layer).


ABOUT THE PROJECT
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Beerodex application is able to keep track of all kinds of beer! The beer is stored in a database, where the information can be sorted, modified, deleted, or displayed. The beer's name, brewery, type, alcohol content, and IBU (international bitunits) are tracked. This program can be used by the home beer drinker, a restaurant tracking their beer menu, or anyone in between!

Features to note are:

1.  Database loads/saves automatically on program launch/close
2.  Database can be sorted by any of the stored fields for simplified viewing
3.  It has a hilariously clever name
4.  Data can be searched and modified or deleted individually
5.  It's beer...it's a pretty awesome topic.
